## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. **Fire Classification (CNN)**
- Detects fire/no-fire in satellite images using **MobileNetV2**.
- Handles class imbalance with **focal loss** and **data augmentation**.

### 2. **Fire Segmentation (U-Net)**
- Generates pixel-level fire masks with **71% IoU accuracy**.
- Uses OpenCV for color thresholding and morphological refinement.

### 3. **Risk Forecasting (Prophet)**
- Predicts daily fire counts (**MAE = 0.72**) and acres burned.
- Models seasonal trends and extreme events.
